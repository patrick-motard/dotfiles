# Global Claude Code Instructions

These instructions apply to all projects where project-specific CLAUDE.md doesn't override them.

## General Preferences

- Never use emojis in commit messages, nor co-authoring from Claude, nor mentions of it being generated by Claude
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones when possible
- Use clear, concise commit messages focused on "why" rather than "what"

## Personal Repositories

- Scripts repo: `~/code/scripts` (GitHub)

## Beads (Issue Tracking)

Beads issues are tracked in these repos only:
- `~/code/zendesk/wiki-zendesk` - Zendesk work issues
- `~/code/wiki` - Personal wiki issues

Do not initialize or look for `.beads/` in other repositories.

## Script Creation Conventions

When creating scripts in the scripts repo:
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` shebang (prefer zsh over bash)
- Include a `usage` variable with NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, ARGUMENTS, and EXAMPLES sections
- Use `while/case` pattern for argument parsing
- Make scripts executable after creation
- Match the style of existing scripts like `new_script` or `compress-video`

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in each project
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- always update the links in the readme toc when adding/removing files in docs/

## NEVER EVER DO

These rules are ABSOLUTE:

### NEVER Publish Sensitive Data
- NEVER publish passwords, API keys, tokens to git/npm/docker
- Before ANY commit: verify no secrets included

### NEVER Commit .env Files
- NEVER commit `.env` to git
- ALWAYS verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`
