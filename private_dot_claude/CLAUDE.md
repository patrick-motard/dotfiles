# Global Claude Code Instructions

These instructions apply to all projects where project-specific CLAUDE.md doesn't override them.

## General Preferences

- Never use emojis in commit messages, nor co-authoring from Claude, nor mentions of it being generated by Claude
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones when possible
- Use clear, concise commit messages focused on "why" rather than "what"

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in each project
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- always update the links in the readme toc when adding/removing files in docs/
